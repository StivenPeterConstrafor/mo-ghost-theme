// Every book abbreviation the citation resolver knows must resolve in
// every form a citation is actually written in.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `faith-resolve.js` turns the editors' apparatus into
// links: 3,235 citations in the Confessions alone, and far more across
// Migne. Both ways it can fail are silent.
//
//   A citation that does not resolve stays plain text. Nobody reports
//   it, because an unlinked reference looks exactly like a reference
//   the editors never linked. Nineteen aliases were in that state —
//   Prov., Gal., Phil., Col., Rev., Mal., Lev., Mic., Luc., Marc. and
//   Apoc. among them — because the roman-numeral branch of the pattern
//   ate the last letter of any abbreviation ending in i, v, x, l or c
//   whenever it was written with the period it is normally written
//   with. They all worked without the period, which is why it survived.
//
//   A citation that resolves to the WRONG book is worse: the reader
//   follows it and lands somewhere else with nothing to tell them so.
//   Six short forms are also ordinary structural abbreviations in the
//   Latin apparatus this library is mostly made of — col. (columna),
//   num./nu. (numero), tit. (titulus), act. (actus) — and "is", which
//   is a word. Those count as Scripture only on an explicit verse.
//
// Neither failure raises anything at runtime, so this is the only place
// either of them can be caught.
//
// Run: npm run check:citations
