/*
 * The Faith Received — which WORKS are bookmarked.
 *
 * EXTRACTED from assets/js/faith-bookmark.js, which until now was the
 * only thing on the site that could bookmark a work and could only do
 * it from inside the reader: it bound to [data-faith-controls], which
 * exists on the reader page and nowhere else. Three surfaces now write
 * the same bookmark — the reader's Save button, the Bookmark button at
 * the foot of a section, and the rows on the browse, author, room and
 * century pages — and three copies of "POST /bookmarks/add" is how the
 * same reader ends up with two records of the same work.
 *
 * "Notebook saves the text and bookmarks saves the place." This file
 * owns the coarsest place there is: the work itself. Where in it is
 * assets/js/lib/faith-position-store.js, and the passage is
 * assets/js/lib/faith-notebook-store.js. A section bookmark is a work
 * bookmark plus a mark, which is why bookmarking from a list row and
 * then bookmarking a section inside that work cannot produce two
 * competing records: they write the same id here, and only the second
 * adds anything there.
 *
 * WHERE THEY LIVE. The mo-kit Worker's KV, the same store that backs
 * article bookmarks, under `bookmarks:<member email>`:
 *
 *   [ { postId: "tfr:<corpus>:<work id>", savedAt: ISO }, … ]
 *
 * Per MEMBER rather than per browser, so it needs MOAuth and it follows
 * the reader between devices. The ids are namespaced "tfr:" and are
 * opaque to the worker: /bookmarks/add and /bookmarks/remove take the
 * id as a string and /bookmarks?ids_only=1 hands them back raw. The
 * enriched /bookmarks list resolves ids against Ghost and drops what it
 * does not recognise, so a TFR bookmark never appears in the article
 * list and never breaks it. The 200-bookmark cap is shared with article
 * bookmarks.
 *
 * ONE FETCH PER PAGE. ready() caches its promise. A browse page can
 * carry two hundred rows, and two hundred rows each asking "am I
 * bookmarked?" would be two hundred requests for one answer.
 *
 * OPTIMISTIC, THEN RECONCILED. set() flips the local set and paints
 * before the worker answers, then puts it back if the write failed.
 * Every subscriber is notified both times, so a row, the reader's Save
 * button and a section button on the same page never disagree.
