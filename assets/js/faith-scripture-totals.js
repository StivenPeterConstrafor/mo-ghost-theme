/*
 * Citations across the whole canon — the Scripture Index page.
 *
 * This file used to draw its own two-column bar chart of every book,
 * stacked above the book-by-book accordion faith-indexes.js draws. Two
 * lists of the same sixty-six books, one above the other, each with its
 * own figure beside each book, and the two figures did not agree:
 * Genesis read 250,677 here and "92,022 references" there. They are
 * merged now. This file still owns the DATA; faith-indexes.js owns the
 * one list, and paints the bar and the figure into the same row that
 * carries the book's name and its disclosure control.
 *
 * WHAT THE FIGURE COUNTS, and why the old two disagreed.
 *
 * v1/bible/all/books.json counts CITATION OCCURRENCES: every place a
 * work in the library quotes or names a passage. 6,037,993 of them,
 * and the file is exactly the sum of the nine per-tradition files
 * v1/bible/{code}/books.json (verified: Genesis 250,677 = 76,118 ed +
 * 21,660 gf + 1,218 hl + 31,507 lu + 7,680 md + 34,001 pl + 2,869 po +
 * 27,148 rc + 48,476 rf, and the grand totals agree to the unit).
 *
 * The accordion's old "92,022 references" was not a citation count at
 * all. It is the sum, over a book's chapters, of the ROW COUNT in each
 * generated per-chapter file, and a row there is one WORK. So it
 * counted work-and-chapter pairs: a work citing Genesis 1 and Genesis 3
 * counts twice, and a work citing Genesis 1 eleven times counts once.
 * It also spans only the four collections whose text has been walked
 * (the Latin Library, Early English Books, Patrologia Latina and
 * Augustine), where this file spans all nine traditions.
 *
 * Both are real and both are wanted, so both are shown: the occurrence
 * count is the figure and the bar on the book's row, and the
 * work-and-chapter count is stated inside the book when it is opened,
 * next to the chapter rows that add up to it. Neither is presented as
 * the other, and the note under the list says which is which.
 *
 * Still deliberately not built: chapter-level density, and a
 * cross-tradition comparison chart.
 *
 * Fault isolation is unchanged and still the point. faith-indexes.js
 * renders a complete, usable accordion knowing nothing about this file;
 * if this fetch never lands, the rows simply carry no bar and no
 * citation figure. Nothing here reads that file's data or waits on its
 * fetches. The hand-off is one way and one object: window.MOScriptureTotals,
 * plus a `faith:scripture-totals` event when it changes, because either
 * script may finish first.
 *
 * The jump control does not reach into faith-indexes.js's markup
 * either. It only ever sets `location.hash` to the id that script
 * gives a chapter's own <details> when that chapter has something in
 * the generated index — `ref-<book>-<chapter>`, built the same way here
 * as there, so the ids agree without the two files knowing about each
 * other. The tradition filter rescopes the figure and the bar, and
 * nothing below them: the generated index has no tradition granularity
 * of its own, so the chapters a book opens to are the same whichever
 * chips are lit. The note says so rather than letting the reader assume
 * the filter reached all the way down.
