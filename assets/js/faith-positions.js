/*
 * The Faith Received — Positions.
 *
 * What a writer is recorded as holding on a doctrine: mined statements
 * grouped by what each one does (asserts, denies, reports another
 * view), each carrying the work and page it was drawn from and a link
 * that opens it in our reader.
 *
 * PORTED FROM the corpus owner's research build, where the same screen
 * appears on four of his pages. His `authors.in03.js`, `topics.in03.js`
 * and `bible.in03.js` are BYTE-IDENTICAL (sha 3c419cbe…) and
 * `fathers.in03.js` differs only in trivia: it is one engine, copied
 * four times, with the page it happens to be on read back out of
 * `location.pathname`. So this is one file, mounted on four pages with
 * different configuration, and nothing below knows or cares which page
 * it is drawing on beyond the attributes in § CONFIGURATION.
 *
 * What was kept from his version, because it is the good part:
 *
 *   - STANCE IS THE HEADING. A statement is filed under what it does,
 *     not under where it was found, so "what did he deny" is one glance
 *     rather than a read-through. Grouping by work is the alternative,
 *     not the default.
 *   - THE LOCI ARE THE ORDER. The doctrine picker is grouped into the
 *     eight classical loci in their classical order rather than sorted
 *     alphabetically or by size. All 43 of his locus labels exist in
 *     our topic registry, verified against the live index 2026-09-11;
 *     the other 137 topics follow under one heading of their own.
 *   - PAGE BY PAGE, AS YOU READ. The index pages at 50 a time behind a
 *     control that scrolls into view rather than behind a "load all".
 *   - IT STOPS. Two consecutive failures halt the surface instead of
 *     hammering a worker that is plainly not answering.
 *
 * What was dropped: his inline CSS, his fonts, his bridge bar, his
 * `safeReaderURL` (it validates against a hardcoded Vercel origin and a
 * `/read` path this site does not serve, so every URL it accepts 404s
 * here), and his comparison column, which belongs to the Compare panel
 * and is already built there.
 *
 * ── CONFIGURATION ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A mount is a `[data-faith-positions]` element. The engine reads these
 * off it and everything else follows:
 *
 *   data-positions-topic        a fixed topic slug ("scripture")
 *   data-positions-topic-param  query param carrying the topic slug
 *   data-positions-author-param query param carrying the author, folded
 *   data-positions-before-year  keep only authors born before this year
 *   data-positions-lede         page-specific opening sentence
 *   data-positions-note         page-specific footnote
 *
 * Which of the two axes the page fixes decides the mode:
 *
 *   author page      author fixed from ?a=      -> pick a doctrine
 *   doctrines page   topic fixed from ?s=       -> pick a writer
 *   scripture page   topic fixed to "scripture" -> pick a writer
 *   fathers page     neither, born before 325   -> pick both
 *
 * ── WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * mo-tfr-library only, read from the tfr-library-base meta tag the way
 * every other Faith Received page reads it. Three shapes:
 *
 *   /v1/mine/topic2-all/index.json    every topic, 4 KB over the wire.
 *                                     The doctrine picker.
 *   /v1/mine/topic2-all/<topic>.json  one topic: the author directory
 *                                     (id, name, slug, shelf, birth
 *                                     year, catalogue counts) and the
 *                                     `evidence` paging contract.
 *   GET /v1/evidence?snapshot&topic&author&limit&cursor&include
 *                                     the statements themselves.
 *
 * `snapshot` is an OPAQUE TOKEN, echoed back so the client's own
 * equality check passes, and the response says so (snapshot_is_opaque).
 * There is no frozen-result store behind it, so nothing on screen
 * presents it as a durable citation and nothing here stores one.
 *
 * THE AUTHOR ID IS THE JOIN, and the topic file is the only place it
 * exists: `/v1/evidence` takes an opaque `a-<hex>`, and neither the
 * shelf roster nor our own catalogue carries one. Ids are global rather
 * than per topic (verified 2026-09-11: Augustine is a-accc1434… on both
 * `sin` and `grace`), but the file has to be opened to learn one, so
 * the resolution order is always topic first, author second, on all
 * four pages. That is why the author page asks for a doctrine before it
 * can say anything at all.
 *
 * ── COVERAGE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The catalogue records 12,075 positions for Augustine on Sin. This
 * library holds 401 of them, because the per-author topic files we were
 * given are capped and the database behind those counts was not.
 *
 * `coverage.positions` carries {held, total, capped, cap} and all four
 * matter. `held` is ours, `total` is the catalogue's, and `capped` says
 * which kind of number `held` is: a count of everything there is, or the
 * ceiling of the file it was read out of. Luther on Justification is 400
 * held against 20,748 recorded, `capped` true, and 400 is the end of the
 * road rather than a page that has not turned yet. A label that read the
 * catalogue's figure and ignored `capped` would render honest exhaustion
 * as a loader that never finishes. (The older flat `total_held` /
 * `catalogue_total` pair is read as a fallback and says one fact less.)
 *
 * Showing 401 as though it were the record is the one lie this screen
 * could tell that a reader would carry away and repeat, and an empty
 * panel that reads as "this author said nothing about sin" is the
 * second. Both are handled in statusLine() and every branch of it is a
 * sentence somebody could defend.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS IN THE BLOCKQUOTE (2026-09-11) ───────────────────────
 *
 * The writer's own words, and nothing else.
 *
 * The index's `q` was never a quotation. It is a machine-written
 * statement of the position, and checked against the works themselves
 * it appears in the text it cites 70 times in 3,240. Ambrose at
 * PL 14:0123 actually begins "Have men assumed so much opinion that
 * some of them established three principles of all things"; the index
 * says "Plato and his disciples posited three uncreated principles —
 * God, the exemplar/idea, and matter (hyle)". Four pages of those, set
 * as blockquotes under a Father's name, would be a fabrication however
 * carefully the surrounding copy hedged. Ian's ruling: no paraphrases,
 * direct quotes only.
 *
 * So `item.q` is now the text at the cited place, read out of the work
 * by the worker (website/workers/tfr-library/lib/locus-text.js), and
 * `item.quote.unit` says how precise it is:
 *
 *   "extract"  the index's own sentence, PROVED to sit at the cited
 *              place before it was shown
 *   "column"   the opening of the cited Migne column, taken whole
 *   "page"     the opening of the cited printed page, taken whole
 *
 * The second is the common case here, and it is the honest one: the
 * index's anchors point at a column's first block and never at a
 * sentence, so the unit of citation is the column. Each statement
 * prints which of the three it is, under the quotation.
 *
 * Every machine-written string has moved to `item.indexer` and is
 * printed under an "Index note" label. Where the passage could not be
 * reached at all the row stays, its citation stays, and the panel says
 * the passage is not held rather than putting the summary in its place.
 *
 * ── POSITIONS, NOT PAGE SUMMARIES ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Items carry `src`: "position", "sample" or "page". A page row is a
 * SUMMARY OF A PAGE rather than something its author said on it and it
 * never carries a stance. Over half the rows in a sweep of 3,531 items
 * were page rows.
 *
 * A panel that files everything under Asserts, Denies and Reports has no
 * honest place to put them: filed under a stance they become claims the
 * writer never made, and filed under "other" they pad the count. So this
 * one asks for `include=positions` and drops any page row that arrives
 * anyway. The page annotations are not hidden, they are NAMED: the
 * footnote says how many exist for the pairing on screen and what they
 * are, so a short list of positions is never read as the whole index.
 *
 * `move` (the extraction's own label for what a statement is doing:
 * thesis, objection, proof) exists on a row here and there and on
 * nothing at all for most authors. It is printed when it is present and
 * nothing on this screen is arranged around it.
 *
 * ── LAZY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing is fetched until the panel is actually on screen. The trigger
 * is an IntersectionObserver on the mount, plus a MutationObserver on
 * an enclosing tab panel's `hidden` attribute for the case where this
 * is ever dropped into the research shell — the reasoning
 * faith-constellations.js sets out at length: attribute mutations are
 * delivered as microtasks, where a ResizeObserver or anything
 * rAF-driven is not delivered AT ALL in a tab the browser is not
 * painting, so a panel woken by one sits blank forever.
 *
 * ── SAFETY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every string here came off the network. There is no innerHTML in this
 * file: nodes are built with createElement and filled with textContent.
 * The only href is the `url` the worker computed for the statement, and
 * it is required to be a path-relative link into /the-faith-received/
 * before MOSafeHref ever sees it. A statement whose link fails that
 * check still renders; it just has no link.
 *
 * `url` is used AS GIVEN and the source row's own `h` is ignored. Two
 * reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one. The owner's
 * `safeReaderURL` validates `h` against a hardcoded Vercel origin and a
 * `/read` path this site does not serve, so it rejects every correct URL
 * and accepts only ones that 404 here. And `url` is the only link that
 * is right for all four collections: pld, eebo and pg works need a `c=`
 * corpus param and pg takes no page at all, so a link rebuilt the native
 * way loads nothing for roughly nine items in ten.
 *
 * Page scripts run BEFORE site.min.js, so the only globals this file
 * may touch at parse time are the boot bundle's. It touches one:
 * MOSafeHref.

     * Two units, and the difference is a claim about the text, so it is
     * printed rather than implied.
     *
     *   "the passage the index marks"       the index's own sentence,
     *                                       proved to sit at the cited
     *                                       place before it was shown.
     *   "the opening of the cited column"   the first words printed at
     *                                       that column, taken whole
     *                                       from the work.
     *
     * The second is the common case for mined positions and it is not a
     * shortcoming: Migne is cited BY COLUMN, the index's own anchors
     * point at a column's first block and never at a sentence, and a
     * column runs to some hundreds of words. Saying "the opening of the
     * cited column" is the true version of what the reader is looking
     * at; implying a sentence would not be. */
