/*
 * The Faith Received — reader survey.
 *
 * A slim bar across the foot of every TFR landing page with one tab on
 * it. Pressing the tab slides a panel up; eight questions go by one at
 * a time, and the answers post once, at the end, to mo-forms
 * /tfr-survey. The results are read on /admin/tfr-survey/.
 *
 * LANDING PAGES ONLY. A work is a page someone is reading, and a bar
 * across the foot of a text is an interruption of the one thing this
 * project exists to do. Which pages are works is decided by the
 * markers <main> carries, never by a path list, for the reasons
 * written out at length in slide-in.js: one reader template serves
 * several routes and the routes move. The four selectors here are the
 * same four, deliberately.
 *
 * ANONYMOUS. Nothing sent from here names the reader: no email, no
 * member id, no Ghost uuid. member_status is one of three words and
 * goes along because "are the people answering the people paying" is
 * worth being able to ask. The worker allowlists it to those three.
 *
 * ONE SUBMIT, AT THE END. The welcome survey at /welcome/ saves after
 * every step, because a member abandoning it half way is still data we
 * are entitled to keep. This one is anonymous and unsolicited, so it
 * writes one row when the reader says so and nothing before that. The
 * cost is that abandonment loses the answers; the answers stay in
 * localStorage meanwhile, so closing the panel and coming back does
 * not.
 *
 * Rides site.min.js rather than ~100 custom-faith-*.hbs templates, for
 * the same reason faith-events.js does: one missed template would be a
 * landing page with no bar, and nobody would notice. It returns on its
 * first test for every page that is not a TFR landing page, so the
 * cost elsewhere is one string comparison.
