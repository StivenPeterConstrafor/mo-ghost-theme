 * Feature gate — blocks clicks on action-row buttons the current
 * visitor isn't entitled to, and presents a modal with the right
 * next step.
 *
 * Tier mapping (Ian, 2026-04-23; pdf moved to member 2026-09-02; ask
 * moved to subscriber for the TFR beta 2026-09-11):
 *   - Members (paid/comped):        audio, bookmark, pdf
 *   - Subscribers (any signed-in):  gift, ask
 *   - Everyone:                     dark mode (no gate)
 *
 * `ask` is the odd one out and is deliberately temporary. See
 * TFR_BETA_OPEN_TO_ALL_MEMBERS below for the switch that puts it back.
 *
 * pdf was listed as subscriber-tier here while article-pdf.js required
 * paid and hard-redirected to /membership/ when it didn't find it. A free
 * subscriber therefore passed this gate, got no modal, and was bounced off
 * the essay with no explanation. Anselm House reported it on 2026-08-29.
 * Resolved in favour of member-tier: the modal now says so, and the same
 * check is enforced in article-pdf.js and in mo-pdf's /sign endpoint.
 *
 * Subscriber-tier features → modal with an inline Ghost magic-link
 * signup form. On submit, Ghost emails a verify link that redirects
 * back to the current post; the subscriber stays on the article.
 *
 * Member-tier features → modal with a prominent "Become a Member"
 * CTA to /membership/, since upgrade needs Stripe checkout, not an
 * email form.
 *
 * Member status comes from body[data-member-status] which default.hbs
 * writes for signed-in users. Missing attribute = anonymous.
 *
 * Capture-phase click handler with stopImmediatePropagation so the
 * existing per-feature handlers (article-audio.js, article-bookmark.js,
 * article-gift.js) don't ALSO fire alongside the gate.

     A link is a door to a tool because of where it goes, not because
     someone remembered to mark it. There are links to the tools in
     sixty-odd files, most of them built in JS (the shelf rows, the port
     engines, the author and Scripture pages), and every one written
     tomorrow would be another chance to forget the attribute. So a link
     with no data-feature-gate of its own is gated by its address: any
     same-origin <a> whose path is one of the tool pages below is
     treated exactly as if it carried the matching attribute. An explicit
     data-feature-gate always wins, and data-feature-gate="open" (a name
     not in FEATURES) is how a link opts out.

     Keys are the first path segment under /the-faith-received/. The
     Research desk routes on its hash, so it is read separately; a bare
     /research/ is NOT gated, because for a signed-out reader that page
     is the one that explains the tools and carries the sign-up form.
     /scripture/desk/ is the Verse Desk, which is Scripture (reading),
