/* The Ask page keeps Mere Orthodoxy's nav bar.
 *
 * .fra is `position: fixed; inset: 0; height: 100dvh` — a dialog that owns
 * the viewport — so it covered the masthead entirely and the Ask page read
 * as a different site. Ian's call: the nav bar belongs there.
 *
 * The workspace is pushed below the masthead in CSS, against --mo-head,
 * and the measurement is here because the reader's boot script is the only
 * other place that sets it and it does not run on this page. Re-measured
 * when the header changes shape; a wrapped two-line header on a phone is
 * taller than a one-line one.
 *
 * Not in an iframe: the Ask source preview frames the READER, not this
 * page, and html.mo-embedded hides the chrome there instead.

/*
 * Open the Ask workspace on /the-faith-received/ask-workspace/.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT AN INLINE SCRIPT. It has to be. This
 * theme's CSP is `script-src 'self' …` with no 'unsafe-inline', so an
 * inline <script> in a template is refused by the browser and never
 * runs. Three fixes for this page shipped inline and none of them ever
 * executed; each looked correct in the served HTML, which is exactly
 * how it went unnoticed. Anything this page needs to do at load goes in
 * a file under assets/ and is loaded with a src.
 *
 * WHY IT OPENS AT ALL. The engine (assets/js/port/ask-workspace.js)
 * opens itself only when the path matches /ask or the URL carries
 * ?ask= / ?m=ask. Ours is /the-faith-received/ask-workspace/, which
 * matches none of them, so it is asked directly.
 *
 * WHY IT RETRIES. The engine publishes window.FRAsk while it parses but
 * finishes setting up asynchronously, so an open() before it is ready
 * can be accepted and then undone, leaving the launcher and nothing
 * else. Rather than model someone else's boot sequence, this opens and
 * then checks: if the workspace is not up a beat later, it asks again.
 * That is right whenever the engine becomes ready. It gives up after
 * about four seconds so a broken engine cannot spin, and the launcher
 * still opens it by hand.
 *
 * Loaded as a page script, so per this theme's script-order rule it
 * runs before site.min.js and must not depend on any site-bundle
 * global. It uses window.FRAsk, published by the engine loaded
 * immediately above it, and window.MOSafeRedirect, which rides in the
 * boot bundle and so is already defined. Nothing from site.min.js.

   * CLOSING A WORKSPACE THAT IS THE WHOLE PAGE.
   *
   * The engine's close() hides the panel and hands focus back to the
   * launcher, which is right where Ask is an overlay sitting on top of
   * the reader: hide it and the reader is underneath. Here the panel is
   * the entire page, so hiding it leaves a blank one, and the X reads as
   * doing nothing (Ian, 2026-09-14).
   *
   * The engine already has a name for this situation, `fra-standalone`,
   * but it sets that class only for the path /ask on its own domain.
   * Ours is /the-faith-received/ask/, so we set it ourselves and then
   * supply the one behaviour the class implies: closing leaves.
   *
   * Watching the `hidden` attribute rather than binding the X means
   * every route to closed is covered, the button and the Escape key
   * both, without reaching into the engine's handlers. close() awaits
   * its draft flush before it hides, so by the time this runs the
   * conversation is already saved.
   *
   * Where "leave" goes: back, when there is a page of ours to go back
   * to, because the button says "Return to reading" and the reader is
   * usually what sent you here. A direct visit or an off-site referrer
   * has no reading to return to, so it falls back to the library.
