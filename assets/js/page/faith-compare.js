/*
 * The Faith Received — Compare.
 *
 * Two to four authors set side by side on one topic, their statements
 * grouped by the work each came from. Binds to custom-faith-compare.hbs;
 * read that template's header for the DOM contract.
 *
 * PORTED FROM the corpus owner's comparison desk (`compareDesk()` in
 * his assets/js/port/compare.in03.js). His interaction model is kept
 * whole and is the reason this file is shaped the way it is:
 *
 *   - the ADDRESS IS THE VIEW. Everything that makes this screen what
 *     it is lives in the hash — which authors, which topic, which
 *     grouping, which stance, which phrase — so a comparison can be
 *     linked, bookmarked and saved without a server knowing anything.
 *   - AUTHORS ARE COLUMNS, capped at four and ordered oldest first, so
 *     reading left to right reads as a reception history.
 *   - THE TOPIC IS THE ROW. The topic list is the UNION of the authors'
 *     own topics with each author's count beside it, so a topic only
 *     one of them treats is visible as exactly that rather than hidden.
 *   - STATEMENTS GROUP BY WORK, collapsible, because "what does Calvin
 *     say about grace" is really "what does he say where".
 *
 * WHAT WAS DROPPED, AND WHY. His desk also carried a "where they meet"
 * finder that pairs statements from different authors by shared rare
 * vocabulary. It is genuinely clever and it is not here, because it
 * presents a lexical coincidence in a layout that reads as a scholarly
 * claim — two passages side by side under one heading. On a publication
 * that says its sources are extracted statements and sometimes
 * summaries, that is a claim we would be making on the reader's behalf
 * and could not stand behind. The columns say what each author says and
 * let the reader do the comparing, which is the honest version of the
 * same idea.
 *
 * WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM. Everything is mo-tfr-library, read from
 * the tfr-library-base meta tag the way every other Faith Received page
 * reads it. Four shapes, all already live:
 *
 *   /v1/bible/<shelf>/rooms/index.json      the roster, per shelf
 *   /v1/bible/<shelf>/rooms/<author>.json   one author: works + topics,
 *                                           each topic carrying a small
 *                                           selection of statements
 *   /v1/bible/<shelf>/rooms/t/<author>/<topic>.json
 *                                           that topic in full (Augustine
 *                                           on Sin: 400 statements against
 *                                           the room's 40)
 *   /v1/mine/topic2-all/<topic>.json        the topic across every author,
 *                                           and the paging contract below
 *
 * ── THE STATEMENTS NOW COME FROM /v1/evidence (2026-09-11) ──
 *
 * They used to be read out of the room and topic files above, and set
 * straight into a blockquote. They should never have been. NOTHING in
 * those files is a quotation: a position row's `q` is a machine-written
 * statement of the position and a page row's `g` is a machine-written
 * description of the page. Checked against the works themselves, 70 of
 * 3,240 position rows appear in the text they cite, and none of the
 * page summaries do. Ambrose's own words at PL 14:0123 begin "Have men
 * assumed so much opinion that some of them established three
 * principles of all things"; the mined row is a summary of that, in
 * somebody else's voice, complete with em dashes the corpus does not
 * use. Forty of those down a column, set as blockquotes under a
 * Father's name, is a fabrication however carefully it is hedged.
 *
 * /v1/evidence resolves each citation against the work itself and
 * returns the author's actual words — see website/workers/tfr-library/
 * lib/locus-text.js. That cannot be done in the browser: a Patrologia
 * Latina work is 150KB to 2.1MB of JSON and a column has to be
 * assembled from its blocks, so four columns of forty statements would
 * be tens of megabytes over the reader's connection.
 *
 * The mined files are still fetched, for the topic grid and its counts,
 * and their rows are the FALLBACK if the endpoint cannot be reached.
 * In that case the column says so in a line of its own and every row is
 * painted as the index's labelled note. It is never quietly promoted
 * back into a blockquote, which is the one lie this screen could tell
 * that a reader would carry away and repeat.
 *
 * SAFETY. Every string on this screen came off the network. There is no
 * innerHTML anywhere below: rows are built with createElement and
 * textContent, and the only hrefs are ones this file constructs itself
 * from an id it has already matched against /^[a-z0-9-]+$/ and then
 * passes through MOSafeHref. The `h` field the data carries IS a URL
 * and is deliberately ignored — it addresses the owner's own site, and
 * re-pointing a fetched URL is exactly the sink that shipped an XSS
 * here before.
 *
 * ── LIVING IN A TAB ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This panel is normally the Compare tab of
 * /the-faith-received/research/, and it is written to work either way:
 * inside that shell, or dropped on a page of its own. Two things follow
 * from being one of seven panels, and both are handled by asking the
 * markup rather than by being told.
 *
 * THE MODE PREFIX. The shell puts the workspace name in the first
 * segment of the hash and leaves everything after the first "&" to the
 * panel (see assets/js/page/faith-research.js for why that grammar).
 * So hosted, this file reads and writes
 * #compare&a=…&sel=…&g=…&s=…&q=… , and standalone it reads and writes
 * #a=…&sel=… exactly as it always did. MODE below is "" or the host
 * panel's name, and it is discovered from
 * root.closest("[data-research-panel]"). The tail after the prefix is
 * unchanged in either case, so parseHash() is the same URLSearchParams
 * call it has always been and a link shared from either shape carries
 * the same five parameters.
 *
 * NOT READING SOMEBODY ELSE'S ADDRESS. When the reader is on another
 * tab the hash names that tab, and this file's hashchange listener must
 * not treat #notebook as an instruction to empty the comparison. It
 * returns early on any hash whose mode is not its own, and keeps its
 * state in memory until its tab comes back.
 *
 * WAKING UP. The roster is nine fetches (one shelf index apiece) and
 * they are the whole cost of this panel. Hidden behind a tab, that cost
 * would be spent on every reader who only wanted to Ask a question. So
 * the fetch waits for the tab: a MutationObserver on the host panel's
 * `hidden` attribute, which is the same signal and the same reasoning
 * faith-constellations.js sets out at length — a ResizeObserver or any
 * rAF-driven visibility trap is not delivered at all in a background
 * tab, so a panel that woke on one would sit blank forever. Everything
 * that costs nothing (binding, reading the address, painting saved
 * views) still happens at parse time.

   * corpus goes in `c=` and the work's own id in `w=`, with `c` omitted
   * for the native collection. `pld-2809` is corpus pld and work 2809 —
   * `?w=pld-2809` loads nothing at all.
   *
   * ── WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES A CITATION LAND (2026-09-11) ──
   *
   * This table used to carry a hasPages flag per collection and append
   * `?p=` on its say-so, and the diagnosis that Patrologia Latina's
   * page was being thrown away was correct. The cure is not to set the
   * flag: the reader CANNOT honour `?p=` for pld, and it cannot honour
   * it for Early English Books either, whatever this table says.
   * openInitialSection() in assets/js/faith-reader.js resolves `?p=N`
   * by looking for the section whose [data-from, data-to) covers N, and
   * only the shard reader writes those attributes. The reader's own
   * pageResolves() says so in as many words: "Early English Books is
   * `gz-toc` and renders sections with no data-from at all: a `p=`
   * there resolves to nothing and drops the reader at the top of the
   * work having promised otherwise." So `eebo: true` here was a lie of
   * the same kind as `pld: false`, pointing the other way.
   *
   * What DOES land, in every collection, is `?q=` — landOnQuote()
   * searches the rendered text for the passage and scrolls to it,
   * retrying while the section hydrates. It only works if the text
   * really is in the work, which is exactly what changed: the worker
   * now sends the work's own words rather than the index's summary of
   * them, and a summary could never be found. That is why a citation
   * used to open at the top of an 881,000-character work.
   *
   * `?p=` is therefore appended only for the native collection, which
   * is the one the reader can resolve it in, and the quotation is what
   * carries the landing everywhere.
   *
   * The statement's own `h` anchor is still not used: it addresses the
