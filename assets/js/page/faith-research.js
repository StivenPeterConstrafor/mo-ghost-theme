/*
 * /the-faith-received/research/ — the tab shell, and nothing else.
 *
 * Seven workspaces on one page (Ask, Power Search, Compare, Bookmarks,
 * Notebook, Constellations, the Desk); this file decides which one is on
 * screen. The mechanism is deliberately the same one
 * faith-tfr-search.js's showMode() uses on the Search page —
 * [data-research-mode] buttons toggle `is-active`/`aria-selected`,
 * [data-research-panel] elements toggle the `hidden` attribute — so
 * there is one tab idiom in this section of the site rather than two. It
 * is a separate file rather than an eighth mode inside
 * faith-tfr-search.js because that file is five hundred lines of
 * Pagefind shard-merging and knows nothing about this page; the only
 * thing the two share is the pattern.
 *
 * ── THE ADDRESS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The hash is `#<mode>` optionally followed by `&<state>`:
 *
 *     #ask
 *     #notebook
 *     #compare
 *     #compare&a=augustine-of-hippo,jerome&sel=sin&g=canon
 *
 * MODE IS THE FIRST SEGMENT, everything after the first "&" is the
 * panel's own business. That grammar was chosen because it is the only
 * one that keeps BOTH halves working unchanged:
 *
 *   - the five hashes that shipped before Compare and the Desk arrived
 *     (#ask, #power-search, #bookmarks, #notebook, #constellations) are
 *     bare tokens with no "&" in them, so splitting on "&" and taking
 *     segment 0 reads them exactly as this file always did. No old deep
 *     link changes meaning.
 *   - Compare's own state is already a URLSearchParams string
 *     (a=&sel=&g=&s=&q=), which is what makes a comparison shareable.
 *     `new URLSearchParams(tail)` parses the tail directly, so
 *     faith-compare.js keeps the parser it had; all it does differently
 *     is write its mode in front and refuse to read a hash whose mode is
 *     not its own.
 *
 * Anything else was worse. Putting the mode in a query parameter would
 * have made every existing #ask link land on Ask-by-accident rather than
 * Ask-by-address and would have put tab state in a place Ghost sometimes
 * rewrites. Giving each panel its own separator (#compare/a=…) would
 * have meant a second grammar for the panels that have no state.
 *
 * THIS FILE STILL KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT PANEL INTERNALS. The tail is an
 * opaque string here: it is never parsed, only carried. What it carries
 * is remembered per mode, so that flipping to the Notebook and back does
 * not throw away the comparison someone had set up — see `tails` below.
 *
 * replaceState, not pushState, on every tab change, same as the Search
 * page, so switching tabs doesn't build a back-button trail through
 * seven panels of one page. replaceState does not fire hashchange, so
 * the listener below only ever sees a real navigation: a pasted URL, an
 * in-page anchor, or the back button landing on an earlier hash.
 *
 * ── WAKING PANELS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing here mounts anything. Ask and Power Search bind at parse time
 * regardless of which panel is visible, which is fine — a hidden
 * [data-ask-form] is still in the document and still has its listeners.
 * The panels whose first act costs something (Compare fetches nine
 * shelf rosters, the Desk creates a paper) wait for their own tab by
 * watching the `hidden` attribute this file toggles, with a
 * MutationObserver. That contract is one-way and deliberately so: they
 * observe an attribute the shell was already setting, and the shell has
 * no idea they are watching. faith-constellations.js documents why it
 * has to be a MutationObserver and not a ResizeObserver.
 *
 * Loaded as a page-template script, so per the theme's script-order
 * rule (FRONTEND §6.18) it runs before site.min.js. It touches no
 * bundle globals at all.

  /* ── Remembering what each panel had in the address ──────────── *
   *
   * The problem this solves: a reader builds a comparison, so the
   * address is #compare&a=augustine-of-hippo,jerome&sel=sin. They open
   * the Notebook to check a note. If the shell simply wrote #notebook
   * and, on the way back, simply wrote #compare, the comparison would
   * still be on screen (faith-compare.js holds it in memory) but the
   * address would no longer describe it, so copying the URL out of the
   * bar would share the wrong thing. Silently handing someone a broken
   * link is worse than losing the state outright.
   *
   * So the tail is harvested off the address the instant before it is
   * overwritten, filed under the mode it belonged to, and put back when
   * that mode returns. Harvested from `location.hash` rather than from a
   * variable this file keeps, because the panels write the address
   * themselves and the browser's copy is therefore the only one that is
   * always current. */
